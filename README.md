# Augmentation Ideal



# Project structure

This project is split into 5 files *AugmentationMap*, *Basic*, *Integer*, *Lemmas* and *IdealNSMul*. 
* *AugmentationMap* includes theorems and lemmas, alongside the definition, of the `AugmentationMap` for
    a given communative group and communative ring
* *Basic* defines the `AugmentationIdeal` for generic communative groups and generic communative rings.
    It also conatins all the theorems and lemmas
* *Integer* contains some proofs about the quotients of powers of the `AugmentationMap` in the case of the integer ring
* *Lemmas* defines some helpful theorems and lemmas about `Finset`, `Finsupp`, `Ideal`, and `BigOperators`
* *IdealNSMul* contains a couple of lemmas and alternitive definitions for scaling an Ideal by a natural number. 
    This file is a result of "going down a rabbit hole* and is _not_ imported anywhere in the project

# Main definitions

The main definition and theorems of this project are found in the three files, *Basic*, *AugmentationMap* and *Integer*.

*AugmentationIdeal.Basic*

* `AugmentationIdeal` is the kernal of a the homomorphism `AugmentationIdeal.AugmentationMap` which sends
  an element of the `MonoidAlgebra` to the sum of its ring coefficients. This is notated by `Δ R,G` where
  `R` is the communative ring and `G` is the communative group
* `AugmentationIdeal.Basis.basis` defines the basis of the Augmentation Ideal to be the set of
  `{MonoidAlgebra.of g - 1 | g ≠ 1}`
* `AugmentationIdeal.aug_pow_is_pow_of_mul_of_univ` states that, when `G` is cyclic,
  `(Δ R,G) ^ n = (MonoidAlgebra.of g - 1) ^ n * R[G]`
* `AugmentationIdeal.quotOfNPow` defines the quotient of `(Δ R,G) ^ n ⧸ (Δ R,G) ^ (n+r)` for some
  natural numbers `n` and `r`
* `AugmentationIdeal.quotNatOverSucc` defines the quotient of `(Δ R,G) ^ n ⧸ (Δ R,G) ^ (n + 1)`
* `AugmentationIdeal.Quotients.quot_torsion` defines a `AddMonoid.IsTorsion` on `(Δ R,G) ^ n ⧸ (Δ R,G) ^ (n + 1)`
  for any `n > 0`
* `AugmentationIdeal.npow_mem.linearcomb_prod_basis` states that any element of `(Δ R,G) ^ n` is a linear combination
  of `∏ i : Fin n, Monoid.of gᵢ - 1` with `R` coefficients for `n > 0`

*AugmentationIdeal.AugmentationMap*

* `AugmentationIdeal.AugmentationMap` defines the ring homorphism that sends a `MonoidAlgebra` to the sum of its
  `R` coefficients
* `MonoidAlgebra.mul_def'` gives an alternative definition to the multiplication of `MonoidAlgebra` such that
   `(f*g) a = ∑ h in G, f h * g (h⁻¹ * a)`

*AugmentationIdeal.Integer*

* `AugmentationIdeal.Integers.Quotients.quot_generating_set` states that `(Δ R,G) ^ n ⧸ (Δ R,G) ^ (n+1)` is
  an additive group generated by the set of elements of the form `∏ i : Fin n, MonoidAlgerbar.of gᵢ - 1`.
* `AugmentationIdeal.Integers.Quotients.finiteGenGroup` defines the AddGroup.FG instance for
  `(Δ R,G) ^ n ⧸ (Δ R,G) ^ (n+1)` when `G` is finite
* `AugmentationIdeal.Integers.Quotients.quot_finite` states that `(Δ R,G) ^ n ⧸ (Δ R,G) ^ (n+1)` is a finite
  when `G` is finite

# Future work

This project only encompasses the first section of the first chapter of the four chapter thesis. Work should be done to complte the remaining parts of the thesis.
Work should also be done to change all current definitions to use non-abelian groups as the result are not dependent on abelianness.
